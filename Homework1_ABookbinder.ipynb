    "## Babylonian square root\n",
    "To get the square root of $y$ Babylonians used the algorithm $x_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}(x_n + \\frac{y}{x_n})$ iteratively starting from some value $x_0$ to converge to $x_n \\to \\sqrt{y}$ as $n\\to \\infty$. Implement this algorithm in a function `babylonian(y, ε, x0 = 1)` (default optional argument `x0`), that takes some convergence tolerance `ε` to compare with the built-in `sqrt(y)`. The function should return the steps it took to reach the square root value within given tolerance.\n",
